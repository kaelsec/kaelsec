# 👋 Hi, I’m Kael (@kaelsec)

I’m a security consultant and platform engineer focused on building next-generation threat analysis tools.

## 🧠 What I’m Building

I’m currently developing **Pentra**, a platform for end-to-end attack path analysis.

🔎 **Pentra** (Platform for End-to-End Threat Route Analysis)  
A modular system that reconstructs attack flows from logs, detects policy violations, maps to MITRE ATT&CK, and outputs explainable reports.
